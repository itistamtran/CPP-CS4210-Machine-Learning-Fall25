Welcome to my Machine Learning class repository for **CS 4210 - Fall 2025** at Cal Poly Pomona.

Each branch in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or project from the course. You can explore different models, datasets, and experiments by checking out the appropriate branch.

## 📚 Structure

- `main`: Base branch (empty)
- [`assignment1-decision-tree`](https://github.com/itistamtran/CPP-CS4210-Machine-Learning-Fall25/tree/assignment1-decision-tree)  
  Train and visualize a decision tree classifier for contact lens prescription using only basic Python structures (no libraries).

- [`assignment2-knn-naive-bayes`](https://github.com/itistamtran/CPP-CS4210-Machine-Learning-Fall25/tree/assignment2-knn-naive-bayes)  
  Includes a 1-NN classifier with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and a Naive Bayes model to predict weather conditions.

- [`assignment3-perceptron-vs-mlpclassifier`](https://github.com/itistamtran/CPP-CS4210-Machine-Learning-Fall25/tree/assignment3-perceptron-vs-mlpclassifier)  
  Compares Perceptron and MLPClassifier models using the optdigits dataset.

- [`assignment4-build-train-cnn-model`](https://github.com/itistamtran/CPP-CS4210-Machine-Learning-Fall25/tree/assignment4-build-train-cnn-model)  
  Builds and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify digit images using grayscale inputs.
